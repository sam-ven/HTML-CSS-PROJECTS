<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is a famous Hanuman temple in West Godavari district of AP. The nearest cities are Eluru and Rajamahendravaram and just 3 km from the town of Jangareddygudem. APSRTC Bus service is available but it is preferable to catch a taxi or an Auto. Parking is available @ INR 20.

    This is a sprawling temple complex. The idol is of Lord Hanuman with a fruit in one hand and a mace in the other and sitting on a Maddi tree. The idol is about 3 feet tall. It is believed that unmarried boys or girls can get married if they do 108 pradakshinas around the temple. Also devotees believe that visiting this temple cures them of many sicknesses and wards of evil.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Maddi Anjaneya Swamy ( Lord hanuman ) temple is at 3 KM distance from Janareddigudem town. The name of the village is Gurvaigudem. Many devotees visit this temple in Tuesday and offer prayer to Lord Anjaneya Swamy. Like any other temple of South India there is nice queue system to get Darshan of Lord Hanuman. There is a special line of Rs 20 to go for a quick darshan bypassing the crowded free Darshan queue.

        There is a tradition of walking around the main temple sanctum 11 times ( known as Pradakshina) before going for darshan and your wishes will be fulfilled in a year time. Each round will take approximately one minute 30 seconds to one minute forty-five seconds depending on your walking speed.This temple is 20 KM from Dwaraka Tirupati</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Development is going on. A new mandapam is being raised.

    Another temple belonging to Lord Venkateswara is connected on the left hand side. Even this temple is spacious. Temple timings are 5:00 am to 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm to 9:00 pm. Best time to visit is in the afternoon. Morning hours experience heavy rush.</p>
